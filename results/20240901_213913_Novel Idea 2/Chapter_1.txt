Chapter 1

Anomaly

The incessant ticking of the clock resonated within the confines of the lab. Dr. Amelia Lawson, a slender figure in her early forties, leaned over her workstation, her brows furrowed in concentration. The display before her was a kaleidoscope of numbers and equations, a symphony only she could decipher. She was on the verge of cracking a code that would alter the course of time-travel science.

Standing in the heart of the Temporal Laboratories, the leading industry in time travel, Amelia was one of the few people privileged to witness and participate in the shaping of human history. However, the thrill of her career had faded with each passing day, replaced by a sense of foreboding. As she stared at the complex algorithm on her screen, something didn't add up.

Suddenly, the lab's alarm system shrieked to life, piercing the silence like a blade. Red lights flashed, casting an ominous glow. Amelia shot up from her chair, her heart pounding. The anomaly detection system was designed to alert them of any aberration in the time continuum. It had never gone off before.

The large screen on the wall flickered and displayed a swirling vortex of colors, an image of the time-space continuum. At its center was a rapidly expanding black void. "An anomaly," Amelia muttered, her eyes wide with disbelief.

Amelia rushed to the communication device, her fingers flying over the touch screen to connect with the Control Center. "This is Dr. Lawson in Lab 3. We have a code black. I repeat, a code black," she reported, her voice steady despite her fast-beating heart.

As Amelia waited for a response, a low growling sound filled the room. She turned slowly, her blood running cold. A creature, unlike anything she'd ever seen, stood hunched over in the corner of the lab. Its eyes glowed a fierce yellow against its dark, scaly skin. It was a being from another era, its presence a testament to the anomaly in time.

Before she could react, the communication device crackled to life. "Dr. Lawson, we need you to hold tight. We're sending someone over."

Amelia's heart sank. There was only one person she knew who could navigate through this chaos. Her estranged brother, Elliot Lawson, the seasoned time explorer. Despite their differences, she knew the situation called for drastic measures.

As the creature advanced, Amelia drew a deep breath. She was about to dive headfirst into the treacherous waters of time, a journey she wasn't sure she would survive. But she was humanity's last hope, and she would do what it took to undo the paradox and save her world. 

And with that, the journey against time began.
